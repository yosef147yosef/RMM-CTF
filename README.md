# RMM-CTF
The CTF involves these key topics: network traffic simulation, DNS request analysis, HTTP communication, encryption (e.g., Vigenère cipher), and reverse-engineering executables. Participants must analyze packets, bypass web security, decrypt data, and reverse-engineer EXE files to solve the challenge and retrieve the flag.
The CTF challenge involves the following key topics:

1. **Network Traffic Simulation**: Creating and analyzing network packets with varying checksums.
2. **DNS Request Analysis**: Sending DNS requests to identify the correct server IP.
3. **HTTP Communication**: Interacting with a web server through HTTP requests, including handling referer and language validation.
4. **Encryption**: Working with encrypted data (e.g., Vigenère cipher) and extracting meaningful information from it.
5. **Reverse-Engineering Executables**: Analyzing EXE files to extract passwords and interact with an SMTP server for the final flag.

These topics cover network analysis, web and HTTP security, encryption, and binary reverse-engineering to solve the challenge.
